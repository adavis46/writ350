## Major Projects

### Digital Media Blog
You will design and curate a blog devoted to a specific issue, topic, or niche in digital media studies and maintain it over the course of the semester. The blog will frame your other projects for the course and connect your work to the “real world.”

### Information Design
Based on the issue, topic, or niche of your blog, you will develop an information campaign targeted at a specific audience. You will write a proposal memo, an audience analysis report, an audience impact statement, and a critical review of a peer’s design. The final deliverable of this project will be an infographic or interactive web text.

### Web Design, Development, and Usability Testing
Based on the issue, topic, or niche of your blog, you will design a website or mobile app for specific users. You will write a proposal memo, develop a wireframe, and build a prototype of your website. Then, you will conduct a small-scale usability study of the design using your peers as testers. 

### Writing for Wikipedia
Based on the issue, topic, or niche of your blog, you team will propose, research, and write an original Wikipedia article (or significantly revise an existing one). You will create a project timetable, write a specifications memo, and submit article drafts and audience impact statements in addition to the article itself. 

### Final Presentation
