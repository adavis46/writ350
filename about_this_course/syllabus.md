### Course Description
This course introduces fundamental concepts of the demands of writing for electronic audiences across a variety of 
platforms, with an emphasis on the interaction of the medium and the message. Writing 350 bridges the study of 
technical communication practice with Web 2.0 technologies and New Media composition. Students in this course will 
develop the vocabulary and practical skills to create, collaborate on, and deliver digital documents in a variety of media 
to real audiences and users.

media

#### Exploration and Argumentation

*user experience.*
- Apply theoretical models to real-world communication scenarios and user experiences.

communication

### Extensions
I am happy to grant extensions on major assignments if I receive a written request in advance of the deadline.

### Revise and Resubmit
If you receive a grade lower than 80% on a major assignment, you may revise and resubmit it. You must write a proposal 
that lists specific aspects of the assignment that you will change (this list must go beyond the feedback you get from 
me). Revise and resubmit proposals are due 2 days after you receive a grade on an assignment. You will then have one 
week (7 days) to complete your revision. The new grade will replace the original grade.

### Attendance Policy
The university requires active participation during the first week of an online class in order to verify student attendance. 
You must complete the first week's activities to avoid being administratively withdrawn from the course.  

Active and informed participation in the course is expected and required.  
 
### Attendance for Students on Scholarship
If a student is attending UM with a scholarship requiring course absences (e.g, athletics, band), the following exception 
applies: students will not be penalized for required absences alone, as long as the student presents to the instructor by 
the end of the course drop/add period an official letter from the scholarship-issuing program declaring the required 
absences for the entire semester. Students whose scholarship-issuing programs cannot produce such a letter, or 
determine a schedule in advance, should take the course during another semester. Letters cannot be amended. 
Students on scholarship who plan to miss 10% of the course should enroll in the course during another semester.

### Online Office Hours
I am generally available online and f2f M-F during regular (Central Time) business hours. Outside of these times, the 
fastest way to reach me is through email.

For online meetings, we'll use Google Hangouts Chat and Google Hangouts Meet (video conferencing).
My Google handle is [addavis@go.olemiss.edu](mailto:addavis@olemiss.edu).  

### Academic Honesty
All work that you submit under your name for credit at UM is assumed to be your original work. While teachers hope 
and expect for you to incorporate the thinking of others in your work, you must credit others' work when you rely upon 
it. In your written assignments, there are only three methods for properly importing the work of others: quotation, 
paraphrase, and summary.

The penalty for plagiarism in Writing 350 may include an F on the assignment, an F in the course, suspension or 
expulsion from the university, or other sanctions. Upon determining plagiarism, the instructor will notify the student and 
the Chair of the Department of Writing and Rhetoric in writing. The instructor will also make a recommendation for the 
penalty he/she finds most appropriate for the offense. Students may appeal the instructor's finding and/or 
recommended penalty by notifying the UM Academic Discipline Committee within 14 days of the instructor's decision.
The applicable full UM policy is ACA.AR.600.001 and should be consulted by any student concerned with plagiarism. 
Broadly speaking, plagiarism is completely avoidable: if you are ever uncertain whether or not you are committing 
plagiarism, ask your instructor.

### Accessibility 
If you have a documented disability as described by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (P.L. 933-112 Section 504) or the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and would like to request academic and/or physical accommodations, please 
contact Student Disability Services at 234 Martindale Center, 662-915-7128. Course requirements will not be waived but 
reasonable accommodations may be provided as appropriate. Please consult the SDS website for more information on 
student disability services.

All course content has been audited for ADA and Section 508 compliance. If you notice something that has been missed, 
please contact the instructor. 

### University Writing Centers
Aside from one-on-one meetings with teachers during office hours, the best way to improve your writing is to work with 
writing consultants at one of the University's Writing Centers. On the Oxford campus, the writing center is on the 3rd 
floor of the Lamar building. Writing consultants will work with any student writer working on any project in any 
discipline. To learn more about Writing Center locations, hours, scheduling and services, please go to the [Writing 
Centers website](https://rhetoric.olemiss.edu/writing-centers/).

### Library Resources
University Librarians are available to help you find and evaluate sources for your papers. Go to the library website and 
click on **Ask A Librarian** for help via live chat, email, and phone. Librarians are available at the Reference Desk on first 
floor in the Information Commons

### Changes
All information in this schedule is subject to change at any time, especially during the first weeks of the semester. I will 
announce changes to our schedule by email and/or through Blackboard. You are responsible for changes to the schedule 
as they arise.
