I wanted to take some time to walk you through the Information Design project and specifically the proposal memo that you have due on Friday. 

Essentially, the information design project is supposed to show you that the efficacy of any message-- any type of information-- is solely dependent on your understanding of the audience for that information. Without the context of the audience, information is really just data. The difference between data and information is audience. The second part of the project-- the audience analysis and impact report-- deals exclusively with this context. 

Hopefully, you've taken some time to look at the full project guidelines, but to review, the deliverables for this project are a proposal memo, an audience analysis and impact report, an information product, and a critical review. In order to understand the specifications for the proposal memo, you have to understand what I mean by **information product**. For all practical purposes, you will be designing either an **infographic** or a **web text** to educate or inform a specifically identified audience. 

### Infographic

You've probably seen lots of infographics, as they have become extremely popular in recent years. An infographic is simply a static visualization of data. Even if they're transmitted and received entirely only, infographics are designed as if they are meant to be printed. They are not interactive and they don't usually include linked text. Make sure you take a look at ["The Science Behind why our brains crave infographics (in an infographic)"](https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/science-brains-crave-infographics) and ["11 Infographics about Infographics"](https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/science-brains-crave-infographics) in the Week 3 Blackboard folder. If you're still looking for inspiration, take a look at the [Infographics subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/infographics) on Reddit. 

There are a number of free tools for creating infographics. You may choose to use whatever you want, but I recommend [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com/). In my experience, its free version has the most features. Other tools place strict limitations on what you can do without paying for their premium services. 

### Web Texts

By **web text**, I mean something that is more dynamic than an infographic, but that falls short of a full website. A web text is meant to be received completely online. A printed version of it would not make sense (unlike an infographic, which can always be presented in print). A web text may include video and audio, but it should not be functionally interactive. It shouldn't **do** anything. A good tool for this kind of design is [Sway](https://sway.office.com/), but there are plenty of other options. Take a look at some example Sways to see the possibilities that are afforded by this medium. Think of a web text as a self-contained, self-playing, interactive PowerPoint presentation. Like an infographic, viewers are meant to receive the text in a specific way and follow an intentionally laid-out path. 

Whether you design an infographic or a web text, your purpose-- your message-- is to educate and inform. 


## Proposal Memo

Once you have a good idea of your basic message and audience and the tool you want to use, you can write the proposal memo (due Friday night). The proposal memo should follow memo format and include the following basic sections:

1. **Message and Background** should review what information you want to convey and how it is contextualized by your digital media blog. Think of this as the "thesis statement" of your information design. It should be as concise as possible and remember that your primary purpose is to educate and inform, not necessarily to persuade. 

2. The **Audience** section should describe in precise detail the audience you envision for this product. It may help to imagine a hypothetical individual or an actual person you know to develop a user story or profile for a realistic audience. The more specific you can be, the better. Your audience analysis and impact report will differentiate your specified audience from other audiences, so it's important that the audience you indicate here in the proposal is distinct. You aren't necessarily beholden to the audience you specify, but if you are confident in your audience selection at this point, you'll definitely have a better time with the rest of the project. 

3. **Evidence and Support** should describe potential sources of evidence for your design. This doesn't need to be a full bibliography, but if the information you want to convey is based on data, you should explain the origin of that data. If you're basing your design on research, you should identify its source. The type of evidence you'll need depends entirely on the audience you identify. 

4. The **Timeline** is your own interpretation of the project benchmarks based on your personal schedule. Write about other obligations you have over the next several weeks and describe how you'll complete the various phases of the project, and when.

5. **Platform and Delivery** should describe the tool you'll use to create your design and your rationale for choosing that tool. You should also give some attention to how the design would be delivered in the real world. You will flesh out this explanation in the audience analysis report. 

6. Lastly, choose a **License** for your work. We will read more about licenses, copyright, and intellectual property next week, but for now, read through the description of the [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) and choose one that makes sense for your project. You can also go for traditional copyright/all rights reserved if that makes more sense to you.

I'll send another walkthrough like this one for the audience analysis report shortly. Hopefully this was helpful; if you're confused, don't hesitate to contact me.
