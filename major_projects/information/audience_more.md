The Audience Analysis and Impact Report is the second part of the Information Design project and probably the most important deliverable. Remember that the overall purpose for this project is to tailer information to a specific, narrowly-defined audience. You are learning about graphic design and project iteration along the way, but because this is a writing class, the relationship between audience and message is the key takeaway.

This report serves two functions. First, it should define and analyze the specific audience for your information design product. Second, it should identify the intended impact of the design on the audience and describe its hypothetical distribution and life cycle. 

## Report Sections
In the proposal memo you identified the audience for the design. I asked you to be as specific as possible, and in my feedback to you I will probably tell you that you need to narrow your scope. The best way to identify an audience that is appropriate for this phase of the project is probably to create a hypothetical individual (or maybe even to use a real person) and describe that person's background and characteristics. Ultimately, you should be able to correlate your design decisions with individual aspects in your audience profile. 

The [Purdue OWL Audience Analysis guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/audience_analysis/index.html) is a great resource for planning your report. It's always a good idea to start with the "journalistic" questions:
- Who are they?
- What do they need?
- Where will they access the information? 
- When will they access it?
- Why will they access it?
- How will they access it?

This basic outline will give you the framework you need to start developing the required sections of the report. There are a variety of charts and graphic organizers on the Purdue guide to help you visualize the characteristics of your audience, but ultimately you'll have to choose whatever workflow is best for you. The last part of the report is a flowchart or system map of your audience's interaction with the product, so you'll definitely want to have some models.

### Background
The report's first required sections is a narrative of the audience's background and context. This is a broad overview of who the intended audience is. This narrative should include basic demographics, cultural and social values, knowledge, experience, education, and any other important factors that will impact how they receive information. 

Let's walk through an example. Say my intended audience is "middle-class high school students in a moderate income suburban area" and my information design is about privacy and oversharing on social media. What are some important factors that might impact my design choices?

- How much access do they have to technology?
- How much free time do they have to socialize?
- What aspects of popular culture impact their online habits?
- What is the role of adults (teachers, parents, coaches) in their lives?
- What is the impact of peer pressure on their behavior?
- What is their attitude towards authority?
- What is unique to their language or discourse (example: memes, emojis, abbreviations)?
- What external pressures do they have?

I could go on, but hopefully you get the picture. Again, it may be helpful to imagine an actual person to develop a realistic background profile. 

### Identified Need
Given the profile you've established and the message you want to convey, the section on need should describe why exactly this audience needs to hear this message. Your purpose is to educate and inform, so think through the specifics. If we continue with our high school student, why is it important they pay attention to the content they share online? What are the implications of oversharing? This section should probably cite examples that justify the need for the information. You could, for example, reference news stories about students losing college scholarships because of content posted on social media. Basically, you need to explain why the information is important within the context of your identified audience's profile. 

### Variability 
Your information probably appeals to a much broader audience than the one you've identified and profiled. In this section, cast a wider net. Who else would find your information design useful? How would the design choices you make for the high school students, for example, affect an audience of teachers? What about high school students from a working class area? Infographics don't exist in a vacuum, especially on the internet. Think about other potential audiences and the implications of your design for those groups. Obviously you don't have to try to nail down all potential audiences, but do try to outline a few significant use cases.

### Where/When/How
Software developers use a tool called a **user story** to think through how a user will interact with an app or website. In this section, you should create a user story for your information product. This should be a **narrative**. Create a hypothetical individual member of your audience and describe how he or she accesses the information and reacts to it. This is your opportunity to be creative. Create your ideal user and explain how your information design will be effective. 

### Barriers to Delivery
In your proposal memo, you had to describe briefly how your information design would be delivered. In this section, you should elaborate on that description and focus specifically on any barriers that could exist to delivery. For our high school students, for example, any infographic that is posted at school would have to be approved by the school's administrators. How would you approach getting permission? How would you ensure that students even see the infographic once it's posted? Basically, think through any potential complications that may keep your audience from accessing the information, and describe your strategy for addressing and overcoming them. 

### Flow Chart/System Map (Impact)
The last piece of the report is a visual representation of the life cycle of your information design. Using a flow chart, social system map, or other visualization, you should show how the design arrives at the audience, how the audience receives it, and the potential impact it has. Do you intend the design to spread virally online? If so, use a visualization to express how it would spread. You can find plenty of examples of this type of visualization online. 

You could even visualize the impact as an infographic:

This section can be as technical or as creative as you want as long as it fulfills the objective of demonstrating the impact of your information design on its audience. Whatever you choose should be original and accompanied by a rationale and explanation. 

## Final Reminders and Considerations
Remember that this document should be formatted **as a report.** Please review the resources on report format, content, and structure on Blackboard. In addition to the body sections above, at minimum your report should include the following:
1. Title page
2. Executive Summary
3. Introduction
4. Conclusion
5. References 

The entire report should run 1250-1500 words. If you find that you're significantly under or over that range, contact me we'll try to work out what the problem is.

This report does require some research. Anything you reference should be properly cited. I do not care what format you use for citations as long as you are consistent. **The biggest danger in this report is generalization or oversimplification.** In your description of the audience's background, any claims you make must be supported with evidence. It isn't enough to rely on your existing knowledge. If you say that teenagers overshare on social media, for example, you must provide a source that supports that claim. The number and type of sources will depend entirely on your topic and identified audience.
