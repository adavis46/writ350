You can think of the second project as a continuation of the information campaign you developed for the information design project, or you can think of it as an opportunity to take your blog issue in a different direction. Just like the information design project, the product you will build (the website or app) is not the be-all end-all of the project. Itâ€™s a means to an end. The real goal of this project is to introduce you to the web design and development work flow and give you more experience analyzing audience. This will probably be the most intense assignment sequence in the course, but I think it will give you some measurable, marketable experience that you can apply in your other coursework or in your career. 

## Project Background and Example

The primary purpose of the web dev project is not to learn how to create websites or apps. You'll get technical experience along the way, but you shouldn't look at this project as a primarily technical exercise. This also means that you shouldn't panic if you are less technologically inclined. **No prior experience is required** for this project. Everyone will be building something that matches their comfort level and experience. This isn't a computer science or web design class. Our focus is mostly on the documents that surround the product, as opposed to the product itself. 

So what might this project actually look like? Here's a hypothetical example to think about: 

My blog focuses on copyright, licensing, and open-source software in general. For the web dev project, I want to create an app that uses a phone's camera and location to find openly-licensed materials based on the user's location or on pictures they take. 

### Proposal

The Background and Message for this project would probably draw from the context I established in the information design project. I would want to specifically indicate that I'm proposing an app, and I would summarize it's basic functions. This section should also address need.

The identified need leads naturally to a description of intended users. This section is a lot like the audience section of your first proposal memo, but it can be more broad. In other words, you aren't required to narrow your user profile to a specific demographic in a specific location at a specific time (unless your project warrants it). 

For my hypothetical project, I would target users who already know about Creative Commons and Wikipedia and are concerned about the outsized role of copyright law in daily life. These users might also be passionate about open source software or other aspects of free culture. They would have at least some technical background. They would probably have some exposure to higher education, but not necessarily. The main differentiating factor of these users would be their curiosity. These are the people that are looking up things on Wikipedia every day. My app would give them another tool to feed that curiosity and advance openly licensed/free culture work. 

Lastly, the preliminary specifications would be where I outline the basics of what my app would do. You are not beholden to the specifications you list here, but you'll save yourself a lot of time if you find comparable apps first so you know what's possible. The more specific this section is, the more structure you'll have to work with when you start working on the wireframe next week. For my hypothetical app, I would write about search.creativecommons.org and explain how I want to recreate the basic functions and app location and camera APIs to make an "on-the-go" version. I would also want to indicate possible tools or platforms I might use to build the prototype.
