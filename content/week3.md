## Blog Post #3: Digital Media and the Law

Your readings this week explore issues of copyright, intellectual property, and public knowledge, all of which have some impact on the topic, theme, or focus of your blog (even if you hadn't thought about it before). Your post this week should explore the legal dimension of your blog. This doesn't have to be about copyright or intellectual property (though for some of you, it is certainly relevant).

So far, your blog has defined what the issue is and explained whom it primarily affects or impacts. In this post, you're going to explain the legal context. You can use that as a jumping off point to discuss social context, too.
