Welcome to Week 3. As you continue to work on your audience analysis report and the information design project, this week's readings will introduce you to some of the basics of copyright and intellectual property. You had to think a little bit about this for your proposal memo, but now you'll get a chance to learn more.

There is a lot of reading this week, and I understand if you can't get through all of it, but in terms of applicability to the future, this material is extremely important. Our society's definition of property and application of legal structures to ideas is fundamentally broken. A major challenge of the 21st century is going to be figuring out how we rethink copyright and IP. 

This week's blog post asks you to look at the legal dimension of your topic. This dimension may be related to copyright, but not necessarily. I would like you to try to incorporate something from the readings (or videos) in this week's blog post, if possible. I would like to have more discussion about this topic, but I realize you are all very busy with the information design project. We'll definitely be returning to it in the Wikipedia unit, though.

If you haven't reviewed it already, please take a look at the "About the Audience Analysis Report" page in this week's folder. Remember that I've extended the deadline for the report to Friday. My reasoning for this extension is to give you more time to send me a draft for feedback, so I would encourage you to do so if you have any questions or concerns.

I'm still working through the proposal memos. I'm going to try to finish most of them by the end of today.
