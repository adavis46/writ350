# Week 1

The main goal in week 1 is to familiarize you with the course projects and the regular weekly workflow. In addition to reading and watching a couple of videos, you will set up your digital media blog, decide on a blogging focus, and complete the first blog post for the semester. 

The readings and videos cover two basic topics:

1. **The Medium is the Message**: You've probably heard this phrase before, but maybe you've never thought about what it really means. This concept is especially important to the idea of digital writing and digital media in general, and in some ways is a key foundation of this course. In many ways, what you write for this class will not be as important as how you write it. The content itself is just your raw material. The short essay and video on this topic should help make it more clear.
2. **Technical Communication/ Writing in the Digital Age**: Those of you who are journalism or IMC majors are probably wondering how this class differs from similar classes you've taken or will take in the J-school. The primary difference is that the theoretical foundation for this course is the field of technical communication rather than journalism. Though there are many similarities, purpose and audience mean very different things to a technical writer than they do to a journalist. The readings introduce you to some of the core principles of the field and the video helps broaden your thinking out to the possibilities digital technology promotes for communication and community.

Your main task this week is to set up your digital media blog. Follow the instructions in this week's Blackboard folder to sign in to [edblogs.olemiss.edu](http://edblogs.olemiss.edu) and generate a new blog with the WRIT 350 template. Then, start thinking about a topic, issue, or focus related to digital media that you want to study for the rest of the semester. There are several ideas listed on the starter post in the blog template, but I encourage you to think beyond this list. Since most of you are Professional Writing Minors, it makes sense to think about digital media issues related to your major or chosen career. If you can find a connection, you'll be able to use this work elsewhere and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. Contact me if you need help brainstorming. 

Once you have settled on a focus for your blog, submit a description of it along with your blog URL to the Google Form link in this week's folder. As soon as I have everyone's blog description, I'll divide everyone into reading groups. I will let you know who is in each group and I'll post the blog lists under the "Blog Roll" link in the course menu. 

Your first post, due Friday by midnight, is a general introduction of you, your blog, and your blog's focus. The only requirements are that it be at least 250 words and include one external reference. 

Lastly, please start reading the project description for the Information Design project. We have 4 weeks on this unit, so you're going to feel rushed if you wait until next week to start thinking about it. I recommend reading through the entire project guidelines document first and letting me know if you have any questions or concerns. 

Please submit your blog URL and focus description as soon as you can. In order to verify your attendance, you have to demonstrate measurable participation. Logging in to the course isn't enough. I will use your blog submission for verification.

Hope your first week back is going well so far!
